Documents
=========
This folder contains all of the game related documents. *Everyone* is welcome to create and modify documents here. The purpose of these documents is to share information about the game with each other.

Each document will initially have a free-form structure, but as more content is added it should gradually be filtered into meaningful sections.

File Format
-----------
For now it seems best to use the .docx file format. If you don't have a version of Microsoft office, [Open Office](http://www.openoffice.org/) is available for free. Please let Nolan know if you have any issues with this.

Directory Contents
------------------

- **Game Design** - Describes all the game mechanics and interfaces in detail.
- **Story Overview** - Outlines the overall plot. Describes significant settings and events. Contains detailed character profiles.
- **System Limitations** - Specifies technical limits that are not to be violated (e.g. RAM usage). Should also contain project policies (e.g. what file formats are preferable for various assets)
- **Look and Feel** - Describes, well, the look and feel of the game. Should include sections on art style, sound design, animation, etc...

To be clear, the goal that these documents will help to achieve is to gradually bring into focus a unified vision for the game. Generally, these documents will summarize decisions that were agreed upon during meetings and/or in email discussions. So it is always best to state how something should be, and then explain why you think it should be that way.
